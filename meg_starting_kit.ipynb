However, there are billions of neurons in the human brain which together form brain structures. Many of the neuron types align and correlate. As you can imagine, in this environment some of the single-cell dipoles are cancelled out while the others add up to form a much stronger signal.

    "There are a lot of things happening in the human brain at every moment, so how is it possible to know which signals to look for? The subject participating in a cognitive neuroscience experiment is usually asked to perform the same task multiple times (watching something on a screen, remembering something, pressing buttons etc.). Then the recorded signals obtained during all the repetitions of the experiment are averaged, leading to noise reduction and cleaner data related to that task. This is related to so-called [evoked responses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evoked_potential). However, a major challenge facing the neuroscientists is to figure out where exactly the signal is coming from. Solving this problem is known as 'MEG source imaging', 'source localization' or 'electromagnetic brain mapping'. See for example [Baillet et al. 200](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/962275) [Mosher et al. 1999](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/748978) [Becker et al.

    "If one denotes by $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ the MEG data at one time point, where $p$ is the number of sensors, one has that $x$ is obtained from a linear combination of sources. The linearity is a fact derived from the linearity of Maxwell equations. Assuming the sources can originate from a finite set of $q$ locations in the brain, one has that the data $x$ is related to the source amplitudes $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^q$ via a matrix $L$ of size $p \\times q$, known as the 'lead field matrix', the 'gain' or 'forward operator'. It represents the sensitivity of each sensor to signals from each source location. For example, if the value of $L_{i,j}$ is high, it means that a signal from the $j^{th}$ source with amplitude $z_j$ would result in a high measurement in the $i^{th}$ sensor, i.e. a strong coefficient $x_i$. Conversely, if the value of $L_{i,j}$ is close to 0, it means that a signal from the $j^{th}$ source would result in a very weak measurement in the $i^{th}$ sensor. \n",
